# Security and Provenance

Research integrity requires more than reproducibility; it requires verifiable authorship. In an era of generative AI, automated scraping, and synthetic media, the ability to prove that a document was produced by a specific pipeline at a specific time is a critical defense against fabrication and misattribution. The W3C PROV data model [@moreau2013provdm] establishes a formal vocabulary for expressing provenance records—entities, activities, and agents connected by derivation, generation, and attribution relations. Digital watermarking, pioneered by Cox et al. [@cox1997secure] for multimedia integrity verification, provides the foundational signal-processing theory for embedding imperceptible provenance markers within artifacts. `template/` implements a domain-specific provenance layer that embeds these relations directly into the PDF artifact itself, using four complementary steganographic and cryptographic mechanisms.

## Threat Model

The steganography subsystem defends against three classes of threats:

1. **Unauthorized redistribution**: A manuscript is scraped and republished without attribution. The steganographic watermark survives the redistribution and can be used to prove original authorship.
2. **Content tampering**: Figures or text are modified after publication. The SHA-256 hash embedded in the PDF metadata detects any modification to the file contents.
3. **Provenance forgery**: An attacker claims to have produced a document they did not author. The build timestamp, commit hash, and pipeline metadata embedded in the watermark provide a verifiable chain of custody.

## Steganographic Layers

The system applies four complementary layers of provenance information:

### Layer 1: PDF Metadata Injection

The `inject_pdf_metadata` function writes structured metadata into both the PDF Info dictionary and an XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) packet:

- `/Creator`: Pipeline identifier
- `/Producer`: Module path (`infrastructure.steganography`)
- `/CreationDate`: UTC timestamp in `ISO 8601` format
- `/Author`: From `config.yaml`
- `/Title`: From `config.yaml`
- Custom fields: DOI, ORCID, repository URL

### Layer 2: Cryptographic Hashing

Before watermarking, a SHA-256 hash of the rendered PDF is computed and stored in:

- The output manifest (`output/manifest.json`)
- The PDF metadata (`/Subject` field)
- An external hash file (`output/<name>.sha256`)

This enables post-hoc verification: anyone with the hash can verify that the PDF has not been modified since rendering.

### Layer 3: Alpha-Channel Text Overlay

A semi-transparent text overlay is applied to each page of the PDF, encoding:

- Build timestamp
- Git commit hash (short SHA)
- Project name
- Pipeline version

The overlay is rendered at low opacity (typically 3–5% alpha) to be invisible during normal viewing but detectable through image analysis. It survives printing (as a faint watermark) and standard PDF operations.

A representative overlay text string takes the following form:

```
template/ | built: 2026-03-19T14:23:11Z | commit: a4f2c1b | pipeline: v2.0.0 | project: template
```

This single line, tiled across each page at 3–5% opacity, encodes the complete build provenance chain: the system identifier, `ISO 8601` build timestamp, short Git commit hash, pipeline version, and project name. Together these fields allow a verifier to reconstruct—from the watermark alone—which version of the code, at which moment in time, produced the document.

### Layer 4: QR Code Injection

An optional QR code is generated containing a URL pointing to the repository (e.g., `github.com/docxology/template`). The QR code is placed in a configurable position (default: bottom-right corner of the last page) at a specified size.

## The `secure_run.sh` Orchestrator

The steganographic pipeline is orchestrated by `secure_run.sh`, a Bash script that wraps the standard `run.sh` pipeline with post-processing steganography:

1. Execute the standard YAML-declared pipeline (16 stages; default full 10) pipeline for the target project.
2. The `secure_run.sh` script invokes `SteganographyProcessor`.
3. Apply metadata injection, hashing, text overlay, and QR code injection.
4. Save the secured PDF alongside the original.
5. Generate a steganography report in JSON format.

The orchestrator processes either a single specified project or all discovered projects sequentially.

## Tamper Detection

Verification is performed by comparing the stored SHA-256 hash against a freshly computed hash of the distributed PDF. Any modification—even a single bit flip—produces a hash mismatch. The alpha-channel overlay provides a secondary, visual verification channel that does not require access to the original hash.

## Limitations

- Alpha-channel overlays are stripped by some PDF optimization tools (e.g., `qpdf --optimize`).
- QR codes are visible and may be removed by a determined attacker.
- The system does not provide non-repudiation in the cryptographic sense—it does not use digital signatures with private keys. Future versions may integrate GPG or X.509 signing.
- The provenance model is pipeline-centric rather than fully PROV-compliant. The path from `template/`'s current metadata-based provenance to full W3C PROV-compliant traces involves four steps: (1) *entity identification*—assigning stable identifiers (URIs or SWHIDs) to each pipeline input (manuscript files, data, config); (2) *activity logging*—recording each pipeline stage as a PROV Activity with start/end timestamps (already encoded in the watermark overlay); (3) *agent attribution*—binding each Activity to the pipeline version and Git commit hash (already encoded in the overlay and PDF metadata); (4) *PROV-O serialization*—emitting the provenance graph as OWL-RDF (PROV-O) or text (PROV-N) alongside the PDF. Steps (2) and (3) are already implemented; steps (1) and (4) are the primary remaining gaps. A future `infrastructure.provenance` module would close both gaps automatically.

## Relationship to Software Supply Chain Integrity

The steganographic provenance layer operates at the *document level*—it certifies the integrity of a specific PDF artifact. A complementary concern is *build-level* provenance: certifying that the pipeline itself was executed with verified source code and dependencies. Frameworks such as in-toto [@torresarias2019intoto] and SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) address this concern by defining attestation chains from source commit through build steps to final artifact. The NTIA's minimum elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) [@ntia2021sbom] further standardize the enumeration of software components and dependencies—essential for establishing the provenance lineage of build environments. SLSA defines four graduated levels of build integrity:

| SLSA Level | Requirement | `template/` Status |
|:----------:|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Provenance document exists | ✓ SHA-256 manifest + steganographic metadata |
| 2 | Version-controlled build scripts | ✓ All scripts in git |
| 3 | Isolated build environment | ~ Docker support exists but not enforced in CI |
| 4 | Hermetic, reproducible builds | N – future work |

Future versions of `template/` may generate SLSA-compatible provenance attestations alongside the steganographic watermarks, creating a two-layer provenance model: in-toto attests that the build pipeline was executed with the claimed source code, while the steganographic layer attests that the PDF was produced by that pipeline at a specific time.

## Relationship to FAIR and Formal Provenance Standards

The steganographic layer supports the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles [@barker2022fair4rs] at the artifact level. PDFs carry embedded metadata (Findability) in standardized XMP format (Interoperability). The SHA-256 hash manifest enables persistent integrity verification (a prerequisite for Reusability). The Documentation Duality standard ensures that the software producing the artifact is inspectable and well-documented (satisfying FAIRsoft [@garijo2024fairsoft] metadata and documentation indicators). Full PROV-compliant provenance traces—capturing the derivation chain from source data through analysis scripts to rendered PDF—are a natural extension and a primary target for future development.

Software Heritage [@cosmo2020softwareheritage] complements this picture at the source-code level: by archiving the `template/` repository and assigning a reproducible SWHID (Software Hash Identifier) to each commit, Software Heritage makes the pipeline itself—not just its output—a citable, persistent digital artifact. A published SWHID alongside the PDF DOI creates a complete, two-artifact citation record: the paper's content is versioned via DOI; the code that generated it is versioned via SWHID. This combination satisfies the Katz et al. [@katz2021software] software citation principles' requirement that software used in research be independently citable and permanently accessible.
