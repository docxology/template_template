## Scalability: From 1 to N Projects

The Standalone Project Paradigm enables horizontal scaling: adding a new project requires creating a directory with `manuscript/config.yaml` and nothing else. No infrastructure code changes, no `pyproject.toml` modifications, no CI configuration updates. The `run.sh` orchestrator automatically discovers new projects and presents them in its interactive menu.

We have validated scaling with ${project_count} canonical exemplars under `projects/templates/`—always present for onboarding and tooling—and with this manuscript from `projects/templates/template_template` (${project_template_template_test_count} tests) as a git-tracked public exemplar in the same automated discovery menus.

Canonical trio:

- **`template_code_project`**: Numerical optimization example with gradient-descent narration and ${project_template_code_project_test_count} discovered tests. Its `pyproject.toml` declares the ${coverage_floor_project}% project-source floor. Minimal footprint: compact `src/`, scripted analysis, short manuscript sections.
- **`template_prose_project`**: Prose-heavy manuscript emphasizing narrative structure and bibliography discipline, with ${project_template_prose_project_test_count} discovered tests and the same declared project-source floor; tests exercise rendering and Markdown integrity without heavyweight numerics.
- **`template_autoresearch_project`**: AutoResearch readiness workflow invoking `projects/templates/template_search_project/scripts/` to run corpus builders, scripted figures (`output/figures/`), and manifold-variable injection (the literature-search exemplar). Typical Stage 02 workloads include bibliography fusion, corpus JSON assembly, deep-search aggregates, and report composition.

Meta manuscript (**`projects/templates/template_template`**) analyzes the repository via `src/template_template/` introspection metrics; it now lives alongside the other public exemplars under `projects/templates/`.

These workspaces share no project-level code—only Layer 1 (${module_count} infrastructure subdirectories, ~${total_infra_python_files} Python files)—validating insulation between domain repos and reusable services.

### Multi-Project Orchestration

When the `--all-projects` flag is passed to `run.sh`, the pipeline executes each discovered project sequentially, running infrastructure tests once at the start and skipping them for individual projects to avoid redundant validation. After all projects complete, a cross-project executive report aggregates metrics (test counts, coverage percentages, page counts, rendering durations) into a unified dashboard with both JSON and Markdown output formats. This executive reporting stage provides repository-level visibility without requiring any project-specific reporting code.

### Scaling Metrics

| Metric | `template_code_project` | `template_prose_project` | `template_autoresearch_project` |
|--------|:--------------:|:------------------------:|:----------:|
| Source modules | ${project_template_code_project_src_module_count} | ${project_template_prose_project_src_module_count} | ${project_template_autoresearch_project_src_module_count} |
| Test files | ${project_template_code_project_test_file_count} | ${project_template_prose_project_test_file_count} | ${project_template_autoresearch_project_test_file_count} |
| Test count | ${project_template_code_project_test_count} | ${project_template_prose_project_test_count} | ${project_template_autoresearch_project_test_count} |
| Manuscript chapters | ${project_template_code_project_chapter_count} | ${project_template_prose_project_chapter_count} | ${project_template_autoresearch_project_chapter_count} |
| Analysis scripts | ${project_template_code_project_script_count} | ${project_template_prose_project_script_count} | ${project_template_autoresearch_project_script_count} |
| Figures (auto-generated) | ${project_template_code_project_figure_count} | ${project_template_prose_project_figure_count} | ${project_template_autoresearch_project_figure_count} |

The infrastructure overhead per project is constant regardless of project size: the same ${module_count} modules, the same ${stage_count} pipeline stages, the same rendering and validation logic. This O(1) infrastructure cost is the architectural payoff of the Two-Layer separation.
