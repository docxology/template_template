# Methods

The `template/` architecture is deliberately bifurcated into a globally shared `infrastructure/` layer and project-specific `projects/` silos. This section describes the four core design patterns, the YAML-declared pipeline (${pipeline_stages_declared} stages; default full ${pipeline_stages_default_full}) pipeline that operationalizes them, and the AI collaboration model that distinguishes this system from conventional research templates.

## The Two-Layer Architecture

The repository is organized into two strictly separated layers:

**Infrastructure Layer** (`infrastructure/`): ${module_count} infrastructure subdirectories—${importable_package_count} of them independently-importable Python packages—comprising ~${total_infra_python_files} modules and providing reusable services. Each importable package has its own `__init__.py`, `AGENTS.md`, and `README.md`, and exports a well-defined public API (the remaining subdirectories, e.g. `config/`, hold shared configuration). The infrastructure layer knows nothing about any specific project---it provides generic capabilities (logging, rendering, validation, steganography) that any project may consume.

**Project Layer** (`projects/`): Self-contained research workspaces. Each project directory contains:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `manuscript/` | Markdown chapters and `config.yaml` |
| `scripts/` | Thin orchestrator scripts (Stage 02) |
| `src/` | Project-specific Python modules |
| `tests/` | Project-specific test suite |
| `data/` | Input datasets and generated data |
| `output/` | Pipeline artifacts: PDF, figures, reports, logs |
| `docs/` | Project-specific architecture documentation |

The two layers communicate exclusively through Python imports and filesystem paths. No project modifies infrastructure code; no infrastructure module references a specific project by name (except via runtime project discovery).

## The Standalone Project Paradigm

Projects are designed to be completely self-contained. Adding a new project requires no changes to the infrastructure layer, no modifications to `pyproject.toml`, and no updates to the pipeline orchestrator. A project is automatically discovered if and only if it satisfies two conditions:

1. It exists as a subdirectory of `projects/`.
2. It contains the file `manuscript/config.yaml`.

This paradigm enables horizontal scaling: N researchers can maintain N independent projects within a single repository, sharing infrastructure without coupling. Each project declares its own testing tolerances, manuscript metadata, LLM review preferences, and rendering configuration in its `config.yaml`. The system currently hosts its public canonical exemplars under `projects/templates/` (${public_exemplar_list}), including this meta-manuscript at `projects/templates/template_template/`.

## The Thin Orchestrator Pattern

All scripts in `scripts/` (both infrastructure-level and project-level) follow the Thin Orchestrator pattern [@gamma1995design]:

- **No domain logic**: Scripts contain zero algorithmic implementation. They import functions from `src/` modules and wire them to infrastructure services.
- **Configuration-driven**: Behavior is parameterized by `config.yaml`, not by hardcoded values.
- **Stateless**: Scripts read inputs, call functions, write outputs. They maintain no persistent state between invocations.
- **Logged**: Every significant action is logged via `infrastructure.core.logging.utils.get_logger`.

This pattern ensures that all testable logic lives in `src/` where it is subject to the Zero-Mock testing policy, while scripts remain thin enough to be audited by visual inspection. The separation draws on the Mediator pattern from Gamma et al. [@gamma1995design], where scripts mediate between infrastructure services and project-specific code without implementing any logic of their own.

To make this concrete, the following contrasts the anti-pattern with the correct pattern:

```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: domain logic embedded in script
def calculate_average(data):          # ← never put computation here
    return sum(data) / len(data)

result = calculate_average([1, 2, 3])

# CORRECT PATTERN: script imports from src/ and only wires
from projects.my_project.src.statistics import calculate_average

result = calculate_average([1, 2, 3])  # ← scripts wire, never compute
```

The critical property is that `calculate_average` in the correct pattern lives in a testable `src/` module, is covered by the Zero-Mock test suite, and can be independently imported, tested, and reused—whereas the anti-pattern buries logic in a script that is invisible to coverage tools.
